# Mutmap

The scripts and files in this repository were designed to roughly follow the MutMap and MutMap+ protocols described int he following papers:

[Genome sequencing reveals agronomically important loci in rice using MutMap](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v30/n2/abs/nbt.2095.html)

[MutMap+: Genetic Mapping and Mutant Identification without Crossing in Rice](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0068529)
